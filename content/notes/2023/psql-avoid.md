Mistakes are often inevitable while working on a software project. When it is related to data though, mistakes can be difficult to fix, and wherever possible, they should be avoided in the first place.

If you're using PSQL, the wiki happen include [this gem of a page that include the features of PSQL that you should avoid](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don%27t_Do_This). Some of them are obvious, while some others aren't. Highly recommend to have the team thats working with the DB to go through them at least once just to be aware of them.
