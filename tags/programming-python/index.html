It&rsquo;s about a a feature of Python that I don&rsquo;t really see in other languages i use such as C#, so I wanted to write about this in case i forgot.
Ok, so the list comprehension is a python feature that, as the name suggest, create a new list based on an existing list.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2012/2012-01-30.pythoncustom-list-sorting-function/>Python – Custom List Sorting Function</a></h2><time datetime=2012-01-30T19:26:00+0700>Jan 30, 2012</time><div class=excerpt>There are several ways to sort a list, where the basic ones is to use the list.sort() method to sort the list without returning anything, or use the sorted() function that returns a new sorted list, but this mostly works only on list that contains basic data types, if we want to sort a list that contains something else (another list, tuple, dictionary, custom classes, etc), we need to define a custom sorting function.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2012/2012-01-12.python-learningpart-3/>Python Learning – Part 3</a></h2><time datetime=2012-01-12T20:10:00+0700>Jan 12, 2012</time><div class=excerpt>Well, I was pretty busy this week, and I haven’t touch too much of Python these days, and even if if I done some exercise on Python, I was too lazy to write up a blog post for it, but I promised I will blog more to keep track of my progress, so here I am writing this.
Ok, so this time, I want to talk about the getting input from the user, and flow control in Python, in other words, I am going to talk about conditional statement and loop.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2012/2012-01-09.python-learning-progress-part-1/>Python Learning Progress Part 1</a></h2><time datetime=2012-01-09T19:55:00+0700>Jan 9, 2012</time><div class=excerpt>Ok, so last time I mentioned that I began learning Python. with the Zed Shaw’s Learn Python The Hard Way as a guide, so far, it has been a pretty good experience. So, in this blog, I will try to summarize what I learned by trying to explain it in a way that I think easy to understand, in doing that I hope I can get more understanding about it.</div></article></div><p class=page-footer>---</p></div></body></html>
