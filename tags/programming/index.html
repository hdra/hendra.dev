There are more-or-less 2 programmers working on this project, an iOS programmer working on an iPad app and an iPhone app, and myself working on the server backend and the data analysis front-end. I said &lsquo;more-or-less&rsquo; because there was another guy working on an Android app, but he currently is working on another project, also, while I do spend the majority of my time working on the project, I am also involved in several other clients projects.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2013/2013-08-20.a-tiny-bit-on-firefox-extension/>A Tiny Bit on Firefox Extension</a></h2><time datetime=2013-08-20T14:33:00+0700>Aug 20, 2013</time><div class=excerpt>I stumbled on this article on creating Chrome extension, and really, it seems really simple to do build an extension for the browser. So, I thought what would it take to build the same thing for Firefox?
It turns out, it is pretty simple as well, but when you are just getting started, find out where to get started aren&rsquo;t really straightforward. The getting started documents aren&rsquo;t exactly well organized. To start with, there are two different ways to build an add-on for Firefox.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2013/2013-07-09.setting-up-development-environment-with-tmux/>Setting up Development Environment with Tmux</a></h2><time datetime=2013-07-09T16:02:00+0700>Jul 9, 2013</time><div class=excerpt>I recently just finished up my bachelor studies, and as I wait for the the convocation, I find myself not knowing what to work on. So, between tying up loose ends with my scholarship sponsor, trying to score a freelance projects, and wasting time watching TV series, I spent my time playing around with various web front-end frameworks and libraries without any particular aims. In doing this I ended up creating a bunch of throw-away projects, and I switch around between them randomly quite often.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2013/2013-04-28.my-first-pull-request/>My First GitHub Pull Request!</a></h2><time datetime=2013-04-28T11:44:00+0700>Apr 28, 2013</time><div class=excerpt>I just had my first pull request! It was a change to the Pelican themes, where I added this theme to the directory there. So, yeah, I didn&rsquo;t actually contribute a patch to an existing project, it was simply adding my repo to the list of theme.
I also learned about the whole pull request process itself. Of course, it is not that complicated in the first place anyway. Basically it involves forking the source repo, create a new branch, make changes on that branch, commit, push to github, and then after the new branch is created on github, there will be an option to initiate a pull request there.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2013/2013-04-26.setting-up-my-github-pages/>Setting Up My GitHub Pages</a></h2><time datetime=2013-04-26T16:50:00+0700>Apr 26, 2013</time><div class=excerpt>Previously, I had been hosting this site on Heroku. It was pretty simple to setup, I can just create an index.php file, then add another .htaccess file to the root of the site, push, and done. In this case, I maintained two separate repositories, one that contains the Pelican project, including the configuration file, the build script, etc. The other repositories contains the generated HTML files.
Now, I recently wanted to try hosting the site on GitHub Pages.</div></article></div></div></body></html>
