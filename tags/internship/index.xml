I had a lot of fun, learned a lot of new stuffs, and last but not least, met a lot of interesting people.
I had to leave the project I was working on, and that is a little bit sad, but I hope I can at least tie up some of the loose ends before I stop working on it to move on the next project.</description></item></channel></rss>
