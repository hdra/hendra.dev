I think I haven&rsquo;t posted anything since I moved to wordpress.com, but well, its time to start playing again.</p><p>So, again, I moved almost everything. Hosting, domain, and also the blogging platform. I have been wanting to try out some of the static site generator for a while now. The most popular one seems to be <a href=https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll>Jekyll</a>. It is built on Ruby, and seems like a lot of people are using it. Problem is, it is kind of a pain to setup on Windows, and I wanted to be able to built things for it, or at least my own theme for my blog, and my knowledge of Ruby doesn&rsquo;t go too far beyond the Hello World. So I continued my search, this time, specifically looking for a static site generator built on something that I can program in, maybe it is C#, Javascript, PHP, or of course Python.</p><p>And indeed I found quite a lot of awesome projects for Python. The most famous one seems to be <a href=https://github.com/hyde/hyde>Hyde</a>. One problem though, the documentation seems to be severely lacking. I went through the website for almost an hour, and I barely have any idea on how to use and customize it. Maybe I&rsquo;ll take another look at it when my Python skills have improved.</p><p>Then, I found <a href=http:///www.github.com/getpelican>Pelican</a>. It is also written in Python, and it&rsquo;s <a href=http://docs.getpelican.com>documentation</a> is just delightful. It shows you how to get started easily, and also how to customized it as needed. Simply awesome. It is also super easy to setup. There is also a Make configuration file that can be used to automate a bunch of stuffs, but the basic commands are easy enough to use. There is a also a script to import data from other blogging platforms, which maybe I&rsquo;ll take a look at later.</p></article><p class=page-footer>âœµ</p></div></body></html>
