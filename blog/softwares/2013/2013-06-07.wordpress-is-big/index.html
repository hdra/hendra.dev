Yes, that sounds silly, I know how <a href=http://yoast.com/wordpress-stats/>big</a> WordPress is, I just never really cared about the opportunity that it provides. I am currently looking for some freelance work to do, and I was pretty disappointed that most of what I found are WordPress jobs. Not that there is any problem with that, it was a wonderful blogging software, but it is a terrible CMS. As it tries to be more of a CMS, a terrible API that is hard to work with is what we have. That is the reason why I would prefer to write a web app from scratch rather than bending WordPress to do what I want, it is just too much work, and for some reason people seems to prefer using WordPress for everything. The other day, I received a request to write an event management website with WordPress. I am not confident that I can do that, since I honestly had a hard time understanding its API.</p><p>When I uploaded my <a href=http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/mog>Mog</a> WordPress theme to the wordpress.org theme directory, I didn&rsquo;t have much expectation. It was just a side project that I did for fun, and honestly, it was my first try on building a WordPress theme for myself (I was blogging on WordPress.com at the time). To be honest, it wasn&rsquo;t that good of an experience. The API are kind of messy, in no small part are caused by having to accommodate a large variety of use cases by its even larger user base. Somewhere along the way I got fed up and decided to just build the things that I need. So, I left out custom menus support, ability to customize the theme via the WordPress option, and I don&rsquo;t even style the drop down menu properly, since I wasn&rsquo;t planning to have any nested menu.</p><p>Then, few days ago, I noticed that the theme has reached 10.000 downloads. I know, that given WordPress' scale, that number is nothing. It is nowhere near the number of some &ldquo;popular"WordPress plugin or theme. Still, it is kind of different knowing that something that I made was interesting enough that it was downloaded by that many people.</p><p></p><p>I came to think that something that I initially considered good enough for me to use, is nowhere near good enough for public consumption, so I decided to start working on the theme again, and make it better. Starting by fixing some of the problems I mentioned above. I still hate how messy the WordPress API is, but it also got me thinking, maybe I should give it a more serious consideration. Even though it is not very likely, I still hope that the WordPress team can consider redesigning the API. There are some <a href=http://john.onolan.org/ghost/>projects</a> that seems promising, but while I am sure they are all great projects, I don&rsquo;t see it can replace WordPress anytime soon. So, I guess it&rsquo;s time to open up the WordPress books again.</p></article><p class=page-footer>âœµ</p></div></body></html>
