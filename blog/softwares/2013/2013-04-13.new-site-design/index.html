The <a href=https://github.com/hdra/pelican-cait>theme</a> should be in use by the time this post is published. In its current state, I wouldn&rsquo;t say the theme is compeletely finished. I tried to make it responsive to screen size changes, but during my testing, I found some problem viewing it in iOS Safari when there is a long line of continuos text in the page. For some reason <code>overflow-wrap: break-word;</code> doesn&rsquo;t seem to work in it, even though it works fine in Chrome and Firefox for Android.</p><p>That aside, the are also a lot of repetition and duplicate codes in the CSS and Jinja2 template. The templates in particular aren&rsquo;t very flexible. There are a number of values that needs to be specified in the configuration file for it to be usable. Pages also can&rsquo;t be listed the normal way since I turned one of the page template into the index page for my site.</p><p>All that said, I think it is ready to be put out there. If I sit on it any longer, I am pretty sure I would lose interest in it pretty soon. As they say, <a href=http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/12/version-1-sucks-but-ship-it-anyway.html>ship early, ship often</a>. Maybe this shouldn&rsquo;t even be a version 1, but it is a start.</p></article><p class=page-footer>âœµ</p></div></body></html>
