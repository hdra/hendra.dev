It was a change to the <a href=https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes>Pelican themes</a>, where I added this <a href=https://github.com/hdra/pelican-cait>theme</a> to the directory there. So, yeah, I didn&rsquo;t actually contribute a patch to an existing project, it was simply adding my repo to the list of theme.</p><p>I also learned about the whole pull request process itself. Of course, it is not that complicated in the first place anyway. Basically it involves forking the source repo, create a new branch, make changes on that branch, commit, push to github, and then after the new branch is created on github, there will be an option to initiate a pull request there. It is that simple.</p><p>I actually drafted this post around a week ago when I sent the pull request, and it just got merged to the master branch earlier today, so here I am updating this thing.</p><p>But, anyway, I got to say, it feels pretty good! and it is also quite a motivation booster for me. :D</p></article></div></body></html>
