myself anyway,</p><p>First one, the ToString() :</p><pre><code>:::csharp
class YourClass{
    private string name;
    private int age;
    public override string ToString()
    {
        return &quot;Name: &quot;+this.name+&quot;,Age: &quot;+this.age.toString();
    }
}
</code></pre><p>The reason to this is, simple, to have an easy way to get a string
representation of your object. Of course, in a way, you can also create
a new method to return the same thing, but it is a good idea to do it
the “C# way”, and the ToString method is always there, so why create two
methods that serve the same purpose? This is similar to the
<code>__string__</code> method in Python.</p><p>The second one, Equals():</p><pre><code>:::csharp
public class MyClass
{
    private int x;
    private int y;

    public override bool Equals(object obj)
    {
        MyClass myclass = (MyClass)obj;
        if(myclass.x == this.x &amp;&amp; myclass.y == this.y)
        {
            return true;
        }
        else
        {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>The reason to do this, is so to have an easy way to compare objects in
C#, as objects are stored as references, a ‘==’ comparison will always
return false, even if they have the same properties values, unless they
actually refer to the same object. The reason to override this method
instead of creating a new one, is the same as the reason to override the
ToString() method I mentioned above.</p></article><p class=page-footer>✵</p></div></body></html>
