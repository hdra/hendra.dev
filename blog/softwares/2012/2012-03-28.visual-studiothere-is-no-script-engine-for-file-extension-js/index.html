every programs I usually use again, one of them is the Visual Studio, and
since I have been messing around with Phonegap these days, I had to set
it up again. I did what I did before, copying the project template zip
file to my templates folder, and I tried to create a new Phonegap
project, but when I try to build it, Visual Studio gives me an error
saying : “There is no script engine for file extension .js”.</p><p>This is pretty weird, since I set it up the same way last time, and it
works perfectly, so I did a bit of internet search, some other people
are having the same problem as well, and most of them suggested the fix
<a href=http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/230/1/Error-There-is-no-script-engine-for-file-extension-when-running-js-files.html>here</a>. I tried it, but it doesn’t work for me, further search leads me
to this <a href=https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/fix-there-is-no-script-engine-for-file-extension/95d58867-3f31-45e3-aeaf-32ecea4d33c1>page</a>, and this is the solution that worked for me. I changed
the file association for .js files back to the Microsoft Window Based
Script host ( it was associated with notepad++ before), and I tried to
compile it again, and everything is good again.</p></article><p class=page-footer>✵</p></div></body></html>
