it is important to also setup a process monitor to make sure the worker stays up.</p><p>One of the most popular process monitor is <a href=http://supervisord.org/>supervisord</a>, which also happens
to be the one included in the <a href=https://laravel.com/docs/master/queues#supervisor-configuration>Laravel guide on queues</a> which
makes it pretty much the default process monitor on a Laravel deployment.</p><p>Many background queue libraries, including the one that came with Laravel
will automatically retry jobs that fails due to an exception. They usually also include
a way to control how many times the jobs should be retried before giving up and
moving it to the failed jobs store.</p><pre><code>php artisan queue:listen connection-name --tries=3
</code></pre><p>One thing to keep in mind is that supervisord also includes a way to control the
<a href=http://supervisord.org/configuration.html>maximum number of attempts to start a process after serial crashes</a>.
When this limit is reached, it will stop trying to restart the process and the process will be put into
the <code>FATAL</code> state. This number is controlled via the configuration entry called <code>startretries</code>, and it defaults to <code>3</code>.</p><p>In most cases, one wouldn&rsquo;t need to change this setting. But, if you set the number of retries
on job queue to be larger than <code>3</code>, you need to make sure that the <code>startretries</code> is also
increased accordingly. If the <code>startretries</code> is set to a number that is less than the <code>tries</code> attempt,
it could cause an issue where <em>the supervisord retry limit is reached before the job retries
limit is reached</em>. When this happens, the process is put into a <code>FATAL</code> state, and the worker process
doesn&rsquo;t get started anymore, <em>halting the entire job queue</em>.</p><pre><code>[program:laravel-worker]
process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
command=php /home/forge/app.com/artisan queue:work sqs --sleep=3 --tries=5
autostart=true
autorestart=true
startretries=5
user=forge
numprocs=8
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/home/forge/app.com/worker.log
</code></pre><p>So, remember, make sure to keep the queue worker tries equal to or smaller than the supervisord&rsquo;s <code>startretries</code>
to make sure the failing jobs get moved to the failed jobs queue before they halt the entire job queue.
Of course this won&rsquo;t help if the queue is full of jobs that keeps failing, but in that scenario, you
should really take a look at your queue worker code anyway.</p></article></div></body></html>
