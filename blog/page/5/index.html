So, in to prevent myself from forgetting something like this again in the future, I am writing this blogpost, to explain the basic of rendering a web page with Django.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2012/2012-03-22.setting-up-python-on-windows/>Setting Up Python on Windows</a></h2><time datetime=2012-03-22T11:47:00+0700>Mar 22, 2012</time><div class=excerpt>Well, it’s a bit late for posting this, considering I have been playing with Python for few months as I posted before, but, I recently reinstalled my Windows, so I need to setup everything once again.

The function is almost the same as the list comprehension, but instead of processing the whole data structures at once, it performs the works one at a time. This would mean less memory usage and performance when dealing with a massive amount of data. To use it, just replace the square brackets on list comprehension with parentheses.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2012/2012-02-25.python-list-comprehension/>Python List Comprehension</a></h2><time datetime=2012-02-25T22:51:00+0700>Feb 25, 2012</time><div class=excerpt>Ok, been wanting to write about this for a while, in case i forgot, but seems like I almost forgot about it. It&rsquo;s about a a feature of Python that I don&rsquo;t really see in other languages i use such as C#, so I wanted to write about this in case i forgot.
Ok, so the list comprehension is a python feature that, as the name suggest, create a new list based on an existing list.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2012/2012-02-23.windows-phonecontext-menu-on-a-listbox/>Windows Phone – Context Menu on a ListBox</a></h2><time datetime=2012-02-23T22:04:00+0700>Feb 23, 2012</time><div class=excerpt>Ok, I have been working on updating one of my windows phone app, Swatch 7. I added a feature that allows user to save the color they picked. I have write more on that on another post, maybe after the app on the marketplace is updated. So, to remove one finished doing that, but I’llof the saved color, I used the context menu provided with the windows phone toolkit. It’s a bit different in the way that I can’t access the selected item of the ListBox the ordinary way ( the selectedIndex returns –1, so that means holding down a listbox item doesn’t count as selecting it).</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2012/2012-01-30.pythoncustom-list-sorting-function/>Python – Custom List Sorting Function</a></h2><time datetime=2012-01-30T19:26:00+0700>Jan 30, 2012</time><div class=excerpt>There are several ways to sort a list, where the basic ones is to use the list.sort() method to sort the list without returning anything, or use the sorted() function that returns a new sorted list, but this mostly works only on list that contains basic data types, if we want to sort a list that contains something else (another list, tuple, dictionary, custom classes, etc), we need to define a custom sorting function.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2012/2012-01-26.python-learning-progresspart-4/>Python Learning Progress – Part 4</a></h2><time datetime=2012-01-26T11:21:00+0700>Jan 26, 2012</time><div class=excerpt>Last time I talked about getting input and a little about conditional statement and looping that should’ve enabled you to start creating the basic application and implement some basic algorithm in Python. This time, I am going to do a review on some of the basic data structures in Python.
The basic data structures in Python are: list, tuples, and dictionaries.
Let me start with dictionaries. Dictionaries basically defines a one-to-one relationship between a key and a value, just like an ordinary dictionary, where a word is associated with its definition.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2012/2012-01-17.wp7-appsswatch-7/>WP7 Apps – Swatch 7</a></h2><time datetime=2012-01-17T00:14:00+0700>Jan 17, 2012</time><div class=excerpt>Summary</div></article></div><ul class=pagination><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/ class=page-link aria-label=First><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/4/ class=page-link aria-label=Previous><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/2/>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/3/>3</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/4/>4</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/5/>5</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/6/>6</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/6/ class=page-link aria-label=Next><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/6/ class=page-link aria-label=Last><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></div></body></html>
