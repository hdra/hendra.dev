It was pretty simple to setup, I can just create an index.php file, then add another .htaccess file to the root of the site, push, and done. In this case, I maintained two separate repositories, one that contains the Pelican project, including the configuration file, the build script, etc. The other repositories contains the generated HTML files.
Now, I recently wanted to try hosting the site on GitHub Pages.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2013/2013-04-13.new-site-design/>New Site Design!</a></h2><time datetime=2013-04-13T19:33:00+0700>Apr 13, 2013</time><div class=excerpt>I finally got to converting the last site design I made to a Pelican theme. The theme should be in use by the time this post is published. In its current state, I wouldn&rsquo;t say the theme is compeletely finished. I tried to make it responsive to screen size changes, but during my testing, I found some problem viewing it in iOS Safari when there is a long line of continuos text in the page.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2013/2013-04-10.another-new-web-theme/>Made Another Design For the Blog</a></h2><time datetime=2013-04-10T09:02:00+0700>Apr 10, 2013</time><div class=excerpt>Recently I have been spending my time messing around with website front-end development. Probably because of I have been trying to write a Pelican theme for my own website. For My own use, I wanted the website to have a landing page, and also another design for the blog index. I made another attempt at the design recently. Here is the landing page:
and here is the blog index:
I also managed to made the design responsive.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2013/2013-04-03.website-progress/>Still Working</a></h2><time datetime=2013-04-03T17:16:00+0700>Apr 3, 2013</time><div class=excerpt>It has been a few weeks since I decided to start blogging again, but well, as usual not much has been done on it. For starter, I initially planned to host it on Heroku, following the tricks outline here, and it is super simple to setup. I had created a new Heroku app, generated the blog, and pushed the generated content to Heroku in just a few minutes. In another minute, and I had setup the custom domain and had everything working nicely.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2013/hello_pelican/>Hello, Pelican</a></h2><time datetime=2013-03-15T13:19:00+0700>Mar 15, 2013</time><div class=excerpt>Well, it has been a while since I posted anything or do anything with my website for that matter. I think I haven&rsquo;t posted anything since I moved to wordpress.com, but well, its time to start playing again.
So, again, I moved almost everything. Hosting, domain, and also the blogging platform. I have been wanting to try out some of the static site generator for a while now. The most popular one seems to be Jekyll.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2012/2012-08-14.some-xaml-syntax-to-remember/>Some XAML Syntax to Remember</a></h2><time datetime=2012-08-14T14:17:00+0700>Aug 14, 2012</time><div class=excerpt>After developing for WPF/ Silverlight for a while, most people will be familiar with using XAML to declare UI elements, but even though I have been comfortable with XAML for quite a while, I don’t really know what is going on behind the stage. Reading Programming Windows by Charles Petzold shed some lights on it for me, so this post is here again so that I won’t forget.
One important thing I didn&rsquo;t know before is that XAML file more or less is just another way to express the C# code, and the XAML elements in it are actually .</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/journals/2012/2012-07-12.i-bought-a-xperia-sola/>I Bought a Xperia Sola</a></h2><time datetime=2012-07-12T17:40:00+0700>Jul 12, 2012</time><div class=excerpt>I bought a new phone.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/journals/2012/2012-07-07.end-of-internship/>End of Internship</a></h2><time datetime=2012-07-07T16:35:00+0700>Jul 7, 2012</time><div class=excerpt>Yesterday was the last day of my internship at Terato Tech, 20 weeks has passed by so quickly.

I had to leave the project I was working on, and that is a little bit sad, but I hope I can at least tie up some of the loose ends before I stop working on it to move on the next project.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/journals/2012/2012-06-26.blocking-time-sucking-sites/>Blocking Time Sucking Sites</a></h2><time datetime=2012-06-26T23:25:00+0700>Jun 26, 2012</time><div class=excerpt>This is just one thing that I do, and it involves some editing on a system file, so do it on your own risk.
