The last time I posted something was in August, so it has been around two months. Since then, many things have changed.
I had my last day in college on July. I had my convocation ceremony on October, so yep. I am officially holding a B.Sc. degree. It was pretty exciting. Also, now I am working as a Software Engineer! I am now officially a professional programmer.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2013/2013-08-20.a-tiny-bit-on-firefox-extension/>A Tiny Bit on Firefox Extension</a></h2><time datetime=2013-08-20T14:33:00+0700>Aug 20, 2013</time><div class=excerpt>I stumbled on this article on creating Chrome extension, and really, it seems really simple to do build an extension for the browser. So, I thought what would it take to build the same thing for Firefox?
It turns out, it is pretty simple as well, but when you are just getting started, find out where to get started aren&rsquo;t really straightforward. The getting started documents aren&rsquo;t exactly well organized. To start with, there are two different ways to build an add-on for Firefox.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/journals/2013/2013-07-11.when-noise-gets-too-much/>When Noise Gets Too Much</a></h2><time datetime=2013-07-11T23:15:00+0700>Jul 11, 2013</time><div class=excerpt>The World Wide Web is an amazing thing. The amount of resources available on it is enormous. You can learn just about anything you can think of with these resources. Recently though, I noticed that amount of low quality content is getting way a lot higher.
Until a few months ago, I collected almost everything I can get my hands on. I bookmarked every programming article I found that looked interesting, even though I barely know anything about the topic.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2013/2013-07-09.setting-up-development-environment-with-tmux/>Setting up Development Environment with Tmux</a></h2><time datetime=2013-07-09T16:02:00+0700>Jul 9, 2013</time><div class=excerpt>I recently just finished up my bachelor studies, and as I wait for the the convocation, I find myself not knowing what to work on. So, between tying up loose ends with my scholarship sponsor, trying to score a freelance projects, and wasting time watching TV series, I spent my time playing around with various web front-end frameworks and libraries without any particular aims. In doing this I ended up creating a bunch of throw-away projects, and I switch around between them randomly quite often.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2013/2013-06-14.setting-up-stuffs-on-linux/>Setting Up Stuffs on Linux</a></h2><time datetime=2013-06-14T19:41:00+0700>Jun 14, 2013</time><div class=excerpt>My Linux system has been pretty much set up for most things I need, since of course, Linux Mint itself comes with a lot of stuffs such as python, and such.

Yes, that sounds silly, I know how big WordPress is, I just never really cared about the opportunity that it provides. I am currently looking for some freelance work to do, and I was pretty disappointed that most of what I found are WordPress jobs. Not that there is any problem with that, it was a wonderful blogging software, but it is a terrible CMS. As it tries to be more of a CMS, a terrible API that is hard to work with is what we have.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2013/making-my-new-linux-less-ugly/>Setting Up My Linux to be Less Ugly</a></h2><time datetime=2013-06-01T14:57:00+0700>Jun 1, 2013</time><div class=excerpt>As I decided to setup a new Linux installation that is lightweight, customizable to my taste, can be made look pretty, and of course, usable, I started looking around for the suitable setup.
First thing I need to decide on is which Linux distribution to use. I can either look for something bare bone like the Arch, and then build up everything I need, or I can just take something that is ready to use, like Ubuntu, and take out whatever I don&rsquo;t need and replace anything I don&rsquo;t like.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2013/linux-again/>Setting Up My Linux on My Laptop, Changing My Approach</a></h2><time datetime=2013-05-29T20:57:00+0700>May 29, 2013</time><div class=excerpt>I tried again and again to setup a Linux OS on my laptop, hoping to eventually making it my main operating system, but, again and again, I find it just not practical enough. There was always something that doesn&rsquo;t work correctly. Things like programs that kept crashing, windows that suddenly froze, drivers not working, or simply, everything being sluggish. All that time, I always kept thinking that Linux on desktop is good enough to be used the same way I use Windows, or maybe, OSX.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2013/2013-04-28.my-first-pull-request/>My First GitHub Pull Request!</a></h2><time datetime=2013-04-28T11:44:00+0700>Apr 28, 2013</time><div class=excerpt>I just had my first pull request! It was a change to the Pelican themes, where I added this theme to the directory there. So, yeah, I didn&rsquo;t actually contribute a patch to an existing project, it was simply adding my repo to the list of theme.
I also learned about the whole pull request process itself. Of course, it is not that complicated in the first place anyway. Basically it involves forking the source repo, create a new branch, make changes on that branch, commit, push to github, and then after the new branch is created on github, there will be an option to initiate a pull request there.</div></article></div><ul class=pagination><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/ class=page-link aria-label=First><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/ class=page-link aria-label=Previous><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/>1</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/2/>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/3/>3</a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><span aria-hidden=true>&nbsp;&mldr;&nbsp;</span></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/blog/page/6/>6</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/3/ class=page-link aria-label=Next><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/blog/page/6/ class=page-link aria-label=Last><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></div></body></html>
