The function is almost the same as the list comprehension, but instead of processing the whole data structures at once, it performs the works one at a time.

To use it, just replace the square brackets on list comprehension with parentheses.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2012/2012-02-25.python-list-comprehension/>Python List Comprehension</a></h2><time datetime=2012-02-25T22:51:00+0700>Feb 25, 2012</time><div class=excerpt>Ok, been wanting to write about this for a while, in case i forgot, but seems like I almost forgot about it.

The basic data structures in Python are: list, tuples, and dictionaries.
Let me start with dictionaries. Dictionaries basically defines a one-to-one relationship between a key and a value, just like an ordinary dictionary, where a word is associated with its definition.</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2012/2012-01-17.wp7-appsswatch-7/>WP7 Apps – Swatch 7</a></h2><time datetime=2012-01-17T00:14:00+0700>Jan 17, 2012</time><div class=excerpt>Summary</div></article><article class=post-overview><h2><a href=https://hendra.dev/blog/softwares/2012/2012-01-12.python-learningpart-3/>Python Learning – Part 3</a></h2><time datetime=2012-01-12T20:10:00+0700>Jan 12, 2012</time><div class=excerpt>Well, I was pretty busy this week, and I haven’t touch too much of Python these days, and even if if I done some exercise on Python, I was too lazy to write up a blog post for it, but I promised I will blog more to keep track of my progress, so here I am writing this.
