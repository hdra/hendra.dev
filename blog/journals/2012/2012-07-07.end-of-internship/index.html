passed by so quickly. I had a lot of fun, learned a lot of new stuffs,
and last but not least, met a lot of interesting people.</p><p>I had to leave the project I was working on, and that is a little bit
sad, but I hope I can at least tie up some of the loose ends before I
stop working on it to move on the next project. There are many things
that I wished I had done better, I wish that I actually write a proper
framework for  the game instead of just writing a bunch of messy codes,
but I hope the code that I wrote won’t cause too much trouble.</p><p>So, well, all in all, I enjoyed my internship very much, and I am very
grateful for the company for having me. Thank you Terato.</p><p></p><p>I would have to go back to UTM to wait for my visa to be ready before I
go back, so well, we’ll see.</p></article></div></body></html>
