The last time I posted something was in August, so it has been around two months. Since then, many things have changed.</p><p>I had my last day in college on July. I had my convocation ceremony on October, so yep. I am officially holding a B.Sc. degree. It was pretty exciting. Also, now I am working as a Software Engineer! I am now officially a professional programmer. I write code for a living. I also just moved to a new place today, so things has been very hectic in the past few months. From the job search, tying things up with my scholarship, looking for a place to rent, starting a new job, all these things has been taking up most of my time.</p><p>The last project I worked on was the WordPress theme that I uploaded on <a href=http://wordpress.org/themes/mog/>WordPress.org</a>, and thankfully the support email has slowed down ever since the theme was moved from the featured themes. I haven&rsquo;t even been spending my free time coding that much. Lack of proper workspace and my dying laptop are what I would blame, but I guess I was kind of tired with all the changes that are happening as well.</p><p>I am rather excited this new stage of life, and I hope I can learn more from my job and the people around it.</p></article><p class=page-footer>âœµ</p></div></body></html>
