The amount of resources available on it is enormous. You can learn just about anything you can think of with these resources. Recently though, I noticed that amount of low quality content is getting way a lot higher.</p><p>Until a few months ago, I collected almost everything I can get my hands on. I bookmarked every programming article I found that looked interesting, even though I barely know anything about the topic. When major tech conferences like Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href=http://www.buildwindows.com>Build</a>, <a href=https://www.google.com/io/%E2%80%8E>Google I/O</a>, or <a href=http://www.pycon.org>Pycon</a> were held, I scanned the videos for titles that looked interesting and downloaded a bunch of them. I saved a bunch of videos from channels like Marakana or Google Tech Talks. I downloaded every single free programming books that people that people on sites like HN or reddit, even though I don&rsquo;t know what the book talk about that much. As you may have guessed, only a very small portion of those bookmarks ever get visited for the second time, I barely watched any of the videos I downloaded, and most of the ebooks I downloaded never even got extracted from the zip archive.</p><p>Up until Google announced the plan to shutdown Google Reader, I subscribed to a bunch of tech blogs, blogs like Techcrunch, or Gizmodo. Every morning, I would have 700+ new items on the reader, and I would scanned through all of them, click on what I find interesting, and mark everything else as read. It lasted for several months, but not only it was tedious, I started to realize many of their article are low-quality link-bait, not fact-based articles that fishes for stupid fan-boy arguments. I don&rsquo;t want to link to them for examples, but I am sure they aren&rsquo;t hard to find.</p><p>So, when Google Reader was shut down, I moved to <a href=http://feedly.com>feedly</a>, and I took the chance to clean up my feeds. I use RSS only to keep updated with some blogs of people whose writing I find interesting. Most of the are only updated occasionally, and I find myself reading almost every single one of them. The only tech blogs I follow are few that I find still publish actual professional news and pieces I enjoy reading, like <a href=http://theverge.com/>The Verge</a>. I keep up with their updates selectively through channels like Twitter and/ or Facebook instead of trying to keep up with everything they published.</p><p>Same case with the stuffs I kept on my hard drive. I deleted every videos and books that I find not too relevant because of the technology changes, or those that I found not too interesting after I went through them briefly.</p><p>It felt great. I feel much more relaxed. During the time I was living with these noises, I felt obligated to read or watch them. Now, not so much. Nowadays, I get my fix from channels such as Twitter, some highly-curated mailing-lists, also the top news on sites like HN and Reddit. I also keep my reading list with Pocket, and keep track of my projects with Trello. It feels good not having to manage them myself (Yes, I know that these cloud services could be shut down any time, but I really hope they won&rsquo;t for anytime soon).</p><p>It turns out, there is a downside to the abundance of information these days.</p><p><em>Edit:</em> Changed on my opinion on the news site.</p></article><p class=page-footer>âœµ</p></div></body></html>
